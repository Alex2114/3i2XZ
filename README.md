# 3i2XZ+ by Reprap.ir
The 3i2XZ+ 3d printer is an improved and enlarged tested successor of the original Prusa Mendel i3. 

Either you want to create a huge reprap Cartesian 3d printer with 400x 200y 300z mm printing area from scratch or you want to upgrade your existing Prusa i3 (or its derivatives) to a machine with dual heated beds and more than doubled printing space, 3i2XZ+ is a well documented and tested machine suitable for your needs. 

Improvements:
All improvements where done after identifying problems of various prusa i3 based machines during 2 years of creating and selling reprap 3d printers. Many Open Hardware projects were used in this version, Which are carefully selected among a huge number of tested open source 3d printer parts and upgrades available online.
